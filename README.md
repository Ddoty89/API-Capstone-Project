Finding medical professionals near your location.

https://github.com/Ddoty89/API-Capstone-Project/issues/1

The user is presented with a landing page with a background video of a happy health family and encouraging the user to stay connected with medical services.  The user presses the button 'Get started' and is brough to the mainContent page where the user selects which area of medical health they want to search through.  The user then pushes the button to initiate the map and start the user location search.  The map loads with the user's location centered on the map and with a call to the better doctor api also centered on the user location. The api will load with and place marker on the map that fit the selected medical professional field selected by the user. The list of medical offices will also populate seperate to the pay to give a different view of the returned data.  The user can also push a button at the bottom of the page to make a new search for another field of the user's choice.

HTML was used for the landing page and the main content for the medical field selection/map display. CSS for styling of the application.  JavaScript and Jquery to manage the API data access and DOM interactions.
